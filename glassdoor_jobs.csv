Join with us as we add to our team of exceptional individuals who will help us take over the world — one mattress at a time.
Position Summary
Companies often talk about wanting “data science” or “predictive analytics” when really all they are looking to do is pay somebody too much money to make pretty Tableau dashboards. Purple is finally at a place where we are ready to move up the analytics maturity curve; to start unlocking the value of advanced analytics across nearly every function of the company (supply chain, manufacturing, fulfillment, marketing, CRM, customer service, etc).

We have use cases galore and need somebody that can come understand the business, assess opportunities and then wield your advanced analytics toolset to capture value (roughly 60% of expected workload).

Purple continues to invest in analytics and developing internal analytics talent. A major part of this role (approximately 30%) is to coach other analysts on the team who are eager to learn more on how to leverage advanced analytics to drive value in their areas. You will be a resource the entire team can utilize to amplify their various domain expertise.

So you’re probably asking yourself what the last 10% of the workload is allocated to. This is time set aside for open exploration. For investigating new methods. New tools. New parts of the business. Really just time for you to dig in and explore things that may or may not even lead to immediate value at Purple.

If you’re more interested in the latest python libraries or TensorFlow features, this is probably NOT the job for you. I need a true practitioner who has the curiosity, technical skills and people skills to join my team and help level-up analytics at Purple.

Qualifications:
Proven track record of applying advanced analytics techniques (regression, classification, and categorization) to solve business problems
Experience with NLP and other text analytics methodologies
